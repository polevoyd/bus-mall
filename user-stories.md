<!-- Part of your assignment today is to write your own user stories. Be sure to consider the multiple roles involved: the marketing research team, the developer, and the focus group participant who will be using the application. Try to write 4-5 user stories for each role. DO THIS STEP FIRST in a file called user_stories.md. The commit logs in your repo will have a first couple of commits for the scaffolding process, but next you should have a 'user stories' commit that is in place before any code is written.

A wise student would take about 30-45 minutes to work on the user stories and also draft a technical plan for the project (a detailed to-do list of things to make, step by step and tested at each stage) before getting into the code. That time spent in thought and planning will make the code flow a lot faster. Give yourself a series of little problems to solve (rather an a ginormous thing that you just wade through and poke at).

Set 'em up, and knock 'em down. -->

Plan your work, and work your plan. -->
