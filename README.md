Bus Mall App

To make this market analysis maximally effective, BusMall wants you to build an app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side) so you'll need to manage the size and the aspect ratio of the images and perhaps edit them a bit; Mac users can do this in Preview (very cool!), plus, there are lots of online tools.

The app's purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.

To keep the product selection process as untainted as possible, you have been instructed to not allow any results to be shown to users until there have been a total of 25 selections made.

The marketing team is not only interested in the total number of clicks, but also the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown. So, you'll also need to keep track of how many times each image is displayed and do the calculations.

You are also responsible for the look and feel of the app, so don't forget a custom font, color palette, layout with semantic HTML, and so on.
